          Introduction: Links between Cultural Heritage and Human Rights
Several links can be established between cultural heritage and human rights:
<ol>
<li> Cultural rights are human rights. This connection is made in Art. 13 UNCh:
- Cultural rights are part of the body of human rights law.
- Human rights may be violated through the destruction of ‘culture’, for example if
cultural property or cultural heritage is destroyed with ulterior motives, such as to
eradicate a group identity. Such acts against cultural property or heritage may, for
example, reveal the intent necessary to establish a crime against humanity or
genocide.</li>
<li> The protection of cultural rights may indirectly protect human rights more widely and
more generally.
- Protecting cultural property and cultural heritage may also concomitantly protect
human beings as it presumes the observance of certain values. Who destroys
objects or expressions of ‘culture’ will be more likely to violate human rights.
- Cultural property/heritage and cultural rights both aim – at least to some extent –
at protecting human identity.
- Cultural identity in its individual dimension of human identity is an aspect of
human dignity. Thus, the protection of cultural property or heritage can be seen as
protecting a human right.
- Cultural identity in its collective dimension may contribute to constituting a group
and hence be one factor giving rise to the right to self-determination.
</li>
</ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        3. Cultural Heritage may, however, also be in conflict with, and even threaten, human
        rights.
        - A concept of cultural heritage may be used as a justification for restricting human
        rights by those who violate human rights.
        - Human rights might require the eradication of ‘outdated’ cultural practices and
heritage.3
- This clash leads to the core of the arguments around the universal v. relative
nature of human rights themselves.
</p>

<p>
  4. There may be a parallel on the level of norm enforcement: individual criminal liability
  may be incurred for the violation of both human rights and cultural property or heritage.
  The intentional destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan or the shelling of the Old Town of
  Dubrovnik or the looting of the Bagdhad Museum may lead to such individual
  responsibility.
</p>
      
      <h3>Changing Terminology, Changing Concepts: ‘Cultural Property’ and
        ‘Cultural Heritage’ in International Law</h3>
<h4>Obligations of States to Protect Cultural Property in Armed Conflicts</h4>
<p>International legal documents reveal a remarkable expansion of the notion of protection
  of ‘culture’. Characteristically, long before the genesis of international human rights in
  the wake of the atrocities of the Second World War,4 ‘cultural property’ (beni culturali)
  was protected in international humanitarian law of armed conflict,5 under customary
  law,6 and through the Hague Conventions of 1899/1907.7 It is in this tradition8 that the
  1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict9
  defines its object:
  Article 1. <span class="definition"about="cultural property">Definition of cultural property</span> 
  <blockquote>‘For the purposes of the present Convention, the term “cultural property” shall cover, irrespective
  of origin or ownership:
  (a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people,
  such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological
  sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art;
  manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as
  scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the
  property defined above;10
  (b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural
  property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of
  archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural
  property defined in sub-paragraph (a);
  (c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b),
  to be known as “centers containing monuments”.’</blockquote>
  <p>
    This definition is explicitly or impliedly characterised by
- referring to high culture;
- comprising only tangible objects that embody culture, such as archaeological,
ethnographical, historical works, objects of art and architecture;11 and
- giving the reason for the protection as being the universal value of the cultural
property. To this extent, the definition resembles closely the one in the 1972
World Cultural and Natural Heritage Convention.12
It follows from this that states are under an objective obligation to protect such property
in armed conflict (or in peace time because armed conflict is a possibility). Although the
purpose of the rules is also to protect the ‘cultural heritage of every people’, i.e. for the
sake of the people, it is not doing so through granting subjective individual rights.13
Sadly, recent conflicts in Yugoslavia (Dubrovnik), Afghanistan (Bamiyan Buddhas)14
and Iraq (National Museum in Baghdad), to name but a few prominent examples, show
that this classic aspect of the protection of culture through the protection of cultural
property remains utterly relevant, so there is a need to strengthen the protection, as
attempted by the 1999 Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954.
Although the thrust of these norms is to protect cultural values per se and objectively, we
can already establish a link to group identities where cultural property of prime
importance for a group is destroyed with the intent to destroy the identity of this group,
for example as a tool for ‘ethnic cleansing’ or genocide.
  </p>
<h4>Expansion of the Notion: From Cultural Property to Cultural Heritage</h4>
<p>It is in this direction of cultural identity that the notion of cultural heritage (patrimonio
  culturale) has expanded and partly replaced the term ‘cultural property’, which reflects a
  narrower western concept of cultural property, with connotations of property as such.16
  The link is a growing body of human rights law in the context of both culture and cultural
  identity. This trend is also a reaction to the problems faced especially by indigenous
  populations17 to protect their intangible cultural property, such as motifs, songs, prayers,
  ceremonies, music, legends and folkore18 which may be threatened just as much as
  tangible cultural property. This qualitative change happened some time in the 1990s.
  Besides the protection of cultural property mentioned above, a new dimension of the
  protection of culture has developed19, that of cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (CICH)
  reflects this concept.</p>
  <blockquote>‘1. The “intangible cultural heritage” means the practices, representations, expressions,
    knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated
    therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their
    cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is
    constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction
    with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention,
    consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with
    existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual
    respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.’</blockquote>
<p>The Convention gives the following examples of intangible cultural heritage:</p>
  <blockquote>‘2. The “intangible cultural heritage”, as defined in paragraph 1 above, is manifested inter alia in
    the following domains:
    <ul>
    <li>(a) oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural
    heritage;</li>
    <li>(b) performing arts;</li>
    <li>(c) social practices, rituals and festive events;</li>
    <li>(d) knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;</li>
    <li>(e) traditional craftsmanship.’</li>
  </ul></blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to the notion of cultural property, ‘cultural heritage’ focuses on an established
    ‘cultural identity’. This means that the concept goes beyond protecting tangible objects of
    objectively or universally recognised ‘high culture’. It also comprises individually or
    collectively subjectively relevant, intangible forms of cultural expressions which need not
    be ‘high culture’ provided that they are recognised by a community or individual ‘as part
    of their cultural heritage’. This feature makes the concept more subjective, recognising
    that it is not so much by ‘material improvement, but by customs and traditions, historical
    identification and religion’ that identity is established. Language and skills may be added,
    and the relevance of cultural to individual identity and hence to human dignity.22 Artistic
    or creative expressions may be both the origin and expression of cultural identity.
    Therefore, they are to be respected, and an alien culture is not to be superimposed.
    Although cultural heritage is a dynamic concept, there is also a historical element to it
    (‘transmitted from generation to generation’). This resounds in the term’s common root
    with the ‘inheritance’ of universal cultural property.23 Therefore, not only the Byzantine
    church of San Vitale in Ravenna, which concomitantly is cultural property, is part of
    cultural heritage, but also the <em>A Tenore</em> song from Sardegna.24 This was recently included on the UNESCO Masterpieces list of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity25, which
    closely resembles the World Heritage list.
    In addition, there is an element of actual or perceived threat to cultural heritage inherent
    in the concept, hence requiring preservation. This is revealed in an exemplary manner by
    the explanation why the A Tenore song as a form of cultural expression needs protection
    in the UNESCO Masterpieces list:</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘Like many oral traditions, the A Tenore song is especially vulnerable to changes in the socioeconomic
structure, such as the decline of the pastoral culture and the increase of tourism in
Sardinia. The diversity of forms and repertoire is slowly decreasing. There is a tendency to
perform on stage in front of (tourist) audiences, which affects the originally very intimate way this
music was performed. Furthermore, many young people emigrate from the rural areas, making the
transmission of the A Tenore songs within the villages increasingly difficult.’26
    </blockquote>
    <p>A further dimension, which is not yet clearly reflected in the 2003 Intangible Cultural
Heritage Convention, was added by the 2005 Convention on the Protection and
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (CCDE): the protection of the
plurality of culture and cultural diversity per se. This opens up new scope for positive
legal obligations – obligations to protect and possibly to promote cultural heritages. It is
not only for the sake of protecting existing and specific cultural identities any more that
cultural heritage is protected, but – not unlike the protection of biodiversity – cultural
diversity is recognized as a common heritage of humanity. It may be debated whether the
protection of biodiversity and cultural diversity are sufficiently similar to share the same
rationale.27 This may at least be questioned with regard to the somewhat utilitarian
rationale of preserving genetic diversity in a biodiversity context. On a wider scale,
where diversity may be considered a value and aim in itself, there may be more in
common.
However, the recognition of the importance of cultural diversity per se is legally
significant because it broadens the scope of legal obligations that can be derived from the
concept of cultural heritage towards positive obligations: not only well established
cultural expressions may claim to be protected from state interference. A threatened
expression of cultural heritage may actively require states to safeguard it. If a threatened
heritage ceases to exist, it is not relevant for a cultural identity any more and would lose
its protection as cultural heritage. However, with an increasing recognition that not only
an individually identity-relevant cultural heritage deserves protection but also the very
plurality of such heritage, active steps might be required to maintain cultural diversity.
This would result in obligations even to maintain and develop new cultural heritage – a
new type of obligation that might be seen as counterbalancing the fact that some cultural
heritages also become unacceptable in view of the development of human rights.28
In this sense, the preamble of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of
the Diversity of Cultural Expressions stresses both the openness by form and substance of
cultural expressions and content and that cultural diversity per se is ‘a common heritage
of humanity’:
</p>
<blockquote>‘Affirming that cultural diversity is a defining characteristic of humanity,
  Conscious that cultural diversity forms a common heritage of humanity and should be cherished
  and preserved for the benefit of all,…’29</blockquote>
<p>There is not only a shift from highbrow tangible cultural property of universal value to a
  more pluralist conception of culture by content and form and geographic perception.
  There is a further shift in what amounts to higher ranking (universal) cultural heritage of
  mankind.30 Whereas traditionally one could make out absolute or universal cultural
  values, today it is at least also stressed in the 2005 Convention on the Protection and
  Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions that the very plurality of cultural
  ‘heritages’ amounts to a common heritage of mankind. This means a shift from a
  substantive identity-based to a formal diversity-based definition, and might be seen as a
  reaction and counterpoint to economic globalisation with its actual or perceived loss of
  diversity.31 This was, for example, also the conclusion of the UN Commission on Human
  Rights’ (Subcommission on Protection of Minorities) Special Rapporteur, who
  formulated Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of the Heritage of Indigenous
  People:</p>
  <blockquote>‘The effective protection of the heritage of the indigenous peoples of the world benefits all
    humanity. Cultural diversity is essential to the adaptability and creativity of the human species as a
    whole.’32</blockquote>
  <p>Calling the plurality of cultural heritage a common heritage of mankind places the
    concept at least from a terminological perspective into the context of the idea of a
    common heritage of mankind developed for physical spaces. It has so far been used for
    the deep seabed, the Antarctic and outer space, which are characterised by being free
    from individual states’ sovereign rights, not being subject to appropriation, being
    managed and their benefits exploited in a shared and equitable manner, and by being
    supposed to be used only for peaceful purposes. The already established concept of
    common heritage, therefore, does not fit cultural heritage very well in so far as the
    common heritage has a physical connotation of space. The recognition of a universal
    value of the plurality of cultural heritage that is inherent in calling it a ‘global commons’
    seems to be more akin to the value-oriented concepts of jus cogens or erga omnes
    obligations or the idea of ‘humanity’ protected by criminalising on the international level
    crimes against humanity.33
    In its other respects, the 2005 Convention confirms the definition of the 2003 Intangible
    Cultural Heritage Convention:34 Culture here is pluralistic, not confined to highbrow
    culture. The concept is broadened from cultural property as an absolute term to cultural
    heritage, which may be more local, more subjective, more relative and in whatever,
    tangible or intangible form, but there must be an artistic dimension and one of creativity.
    In its orientation towards identity and its historic dimension (‘passed on’), cultural
    heritage differs from another one to be found in the context of the protection of culture
    and cultural rights: that of cultural life. The concept of cultural expression can be seen as the mediator between cultural life and cultural heritage. On the one hand, it is oriented
    towards identity and by has a historic dimension, shared by cultural heritage; on the other
    hand, the Convention stresses the plurality of cultural expression which brings it close to
    the concept or cultural life.</p>

    <h4>Cultural Life</h4>
    <p>Looking at ‘culture’ in a legal framework, a further concept and meaning can be
      distinguished: cultural life (vita culturale) in an anthropological meaning35, describes a
      community’s way of life in a pluralist sense. It is even broader than the concept of
      cultural heritage and comprises wider forms of creative or expressive activity.</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘The totality of the knowledge and practices, both intellectual and material, of each of the
particular groups of a society, and – at a certain level – of a society itself as a whole. From food to
dress, from household techniques to industrial techniques, from forms of politeness to mass media,
from work rhythm to the learning of family rules, all human practices, all invented and
manufactured materials are concerned and constitute, in their relationships and their totality,
“culture”’.36
    </blockquote>
    <p>‘Cultural life’ is reflected in the human right to participate freely in cultural life in Art. 27
      of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Art. 15 of the 1966 International
      Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)37 and has been elaborated
      upon in the 1976 UNESCO Recommendation on Participation in Cultural Life. The
      Recommendation especially broadens the concept of culture</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘to include all forms of creativity and expression of groups or individuals, both in their ways of
life and in their artistic activities’.38
    </blockquote>
    <p>The preamble states the reason for this:</p>
    <blockquote>‘culture is not merely an accumulation of works and knowledge which an elite produces, collects
      and conserves in order to place it within reach of all; or that a people rich in its past and its
      heritage offers to others as a model which their own history has failed to provide for them; that
      culture is not limited to access to works of art and the humanities, but is at one and the same time
      the acquisition of knowledge, the demand for a way of life and the need to communicate.’39</blockquote>
    
    <p>With a broad understanding of ‘cultural heritage’, there is a great deal of overlap between
      cultural life and cultural heritage. In contrast to the concept of cultural heritage, on the
      one hand, there appears to be no necessary (but a possible) link to expressions of human
      creativity with the idea of cultural life; other forms of expression, such as sports, games
      and hobbies, could be included.40 On the other hand even a certain sport, say cricket, may
      be said to express a creative idea of a group in the wider sense and thus participate in the
      cultural heritage of a group – or nation. Yet it should be possible to distinguish – at least
      in theory – between mere ‘cultural life’ or the human right to participate in cultural life
      and ‘cultural heritage’ along the lines of cultural identity, because there is at least not
      necessarily a dimension of cultural identity in all forms of cultural life.41 In practice, it
      will be very difficult to distinguish whether practices are relevant for cultural identity or
      not. Even where they are not, cultural heritage and cultural life and cultural rights on an
      individual level share one of their rationales – to allow for the free development of the
      individual in the context of his or her community.
      Wherever the distinction may be drawn, the right to participate in cultural life is
      important for the concept of cultural heritage as a right to develop a cultural identity and
      hence new forms of cultural heritage.42 While potentially all forms of expression can
      make this transition to become identity-relevant, many of them will not.</p>
      <h4>Cultural Rights</h4>
      <p>Cultural rights (diritti culturali) as laid down as a second generation of human rights,
        most prominently in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
        of 1966, are individual human rights in the sphere of culture to engage in, participate in
        and to oblige the state ‘to the maximum of its available resources’43 to maintain and
        promote an infrastructure of culture, such as education. They are likely to be more clearly
        defined rights that also incidentally protect cultural heritage. They are thus related to
        individual identity and the development of a personality, linking cultural rights and human dignity. Although they are conceptualised as individual rights, they may have a
        collective connotation where the exercise of a cultural right requires communication,
        similar to the right of assembly. In contrast to the concept of a cultural heritage, they do
        not make reference to cultural identity, especially not that of a group. They can, however,
        function as the precondition for identity-based rights and as a starting point for the
        evolution of new expressions of cultural heritage.</p>
