          Introduction: Links between Cultural Heritage and Human Rights
Several links can be established between cultural heritage and human rights:
<ol>
<li> Cultural rights are human rights. This connection is made in Art. 13 UNCh:
- Cultural rights are part of the body of human rights law.
- Human rights may be violated through the destruction of ‘culture’, for example if
cultural property or cultural heritage is destroyed with ulterior motives, such as to
eradicate a group identity. Such acts against cultural property or heritage may, for
example, reveal the intent necessary to establish a crime against humanity or
genocide.</li>
<li> The protection of cultural rights may indirectly protect human rights more widely and
more generally.
- Protecting cultural property and cultural heritage may also concomitantly protect
human beings as it presumes the observance of certain values. Who destroys
objects or expressions of ‘culture’ will be more likely to violate human rights.
- Cultural property/heritage and cultural rights both aim – at least to some extent –
at protecting human identity.
- Cultural identity in its individual dimension of human identity is an aspect of
human dignity. Thus, the protection of cultural property or heritage can be seen as
protecting a human right.
- Cultural identity in its collective dimension may contribute to constituting a group
and hence be one factor giving rise to the right to self-determination.
</li>
</ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        3. Cultural Heritage may, however, also be in conflict with, and even threaten, human
        rights.
        - A concept of cultural heritage may be used as a justification for restricting human
        rights by those who violate human rights.
        - Human rights might require the eradication of ‘outdated’ cultural practices and
heritage.3
- This clash leads to the core of the arguments around the universal v. relative
nature of human rights themselves.
</p>

<p>
  4. There may be a parallel on the level of norm enforcement: individual criminal liability
  may be incurred for the violation of both human rights and cultural property or heritage.
  The intentional destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan or the shelling of the Old Town of
  Dubrovnik or the looting of the Bagdhad Museum may lead to such individual
  responsibility.

      <h3>Changing Terminology, Changing Concepts: ‘Cultural Property’ and
        ‘Cultural Heritage’ in International Law</h3>
<h4>Obligations of States to Protect Cultural Property in Armed Conflicts</h4>
<p>International legal documents reveal a remarkable expansion of the notion of protection
  of ‘culture’. Characteristically, long before the genesis of international human rights in
  the wake of the atrocities of the Second World War,4 ‘cultural property’ (beni culturali)
  was protected in international humanitarian law of armed conflict,5 under customary
  law,6 and through the Hague Conventions of 1899/1907.7 It is in this tradition8 that the
  1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict9
  defines its object:
  Article 1. <span class="definition"about="cultural property">Definition of cultural property</span> 
  <blockquote>‘For the purposes of the present Convention, the term “cultural property” shall cover, irrespective
  of origin or ownership:
  (a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people,
  such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological
  sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art;
  manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as
  scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the
  property defined above;10
  (b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural
  property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of
  archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural
  property defined in sub-paragraph (a);
  (c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b),
  to be known as “centers containing monuments”.’</blockquote>
  <p>
    This definition is explicitly or impliedly characterised by
- referring to high culture;
- comprising only tangible objects that embody culture, such as archaeological,
ethnographical, historical works, objects of art and architecture;11 and
- giving the reason for the protection as being the universal value of the cultural
property. To this extent, the definition resembles closely the one in the 1972
World Cultural and Natural Heritage Convention.12
It follows from this that states are under an objective obligation to protect such property
in armed conflict (or in peace time because armed conflict is a possibility). Although the
purpose of the rules is also to protect the ‘cultural heritage of every people’, i.e. for the
sake of the people, it is not doing so through granting subjective individual rights.13
Sadly, recent conflicts in Yugoslavia (Dubrovnik), Afghanistan (Bamiyan Buddhas)14
and Iraq (National Museum in Baghdad), to name but a few prominent examples, show
that this classic aspect of the protection of culture through the protection of cultural
property remains utterly relevant, so there is a need to strengthen the protection, as
attempted by the 1999 Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954.
Although the thrust of these norms is to protect cultural values per se and objectively, we
can already establish a link to group identities where cultural property of prime
importance for a group is destroyed with the intent to destroy the identity of this group,
for example as a tool for ‘ethnic cleansing’ or genocide.
  </p>
<h4>Expansion of the Notion: From Cultural Property to Cultural Heritage</h4>
<p>It is in this direction of cultural identity that the notion of cultural heritage (patrimonio
  culturale) has expanded and partly replaced the term ‘cultural property’, which reflects a
  narrower western concept of cultural property, with connotations of property as such.16
  The link is a growing body of human rights law in the context of both culture and cultural
  identity. This trend is also a reaction to the problems faced especially by indigenous
  populations17 to protect their intangible cultural property, such as motifs, songs, prayers,
  ceremonies, music, legends and folkore18 which may be threatened just as much as
  tangible cultural property. This qualitative change happened some time in the 1990s.
  Besides the protection of cultural property mentioned above, a new dimension of the
  protection of culture has developed19, that of cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (CICH)
  reflects this concept.</p>
  <blockquote>‘1. The “intangible cultural heritage” means the practices, representations, expressions,
    knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated
    therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their
    cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is
    constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction
    with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention,
    consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with
    existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual
    respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.’</blockquote>
<p>The Convention gives the following examples of intangible cultural heritage:</p>
  <blockquote>‘2. The “intangible cultural heritage”, as defined in paragraph 1 above, is manifested inter alia in
    the following domains:
    <ul>
    <li>(a) oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural
    heritage;</li>
    <li>(b) performing arts;</li>
    <li>(c) social practices, rituals and festive events;</li>
    <li>(d) knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;</li>
    <li>(e) traditional craftsmanship.’</li>
  </ul></blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to the notion of cultural property, ‘cultural heritage’ focuses on an established
    ‘cultural identity’. This means that the concept goes beyond protecting tangible objects of
    objectively or universally recognised ‘high culture’. It also comprises individually or
    collectively subjectively relevant, intangible forms of cultural expressions which need not
    be ‘high culture’ provided that they are recognised by a community or individual ‘as part
    of their cultural heritage’. This feature makes the concept more subjective, recognising
    that it is not so much by ‘material improvement, but by customs and traditions, historical
    identification and religion’ that identity is established. Language and skills may be added,
    and the relevance of cultural to individual identity and hence to human dignity.22 Artistic
    or creative expressions may be both the origin and expression of cultural identity.
    Therefore, they are to be respected, and an alien culture is not to be superimposed.
    Although cultural heritage is a dynamic concept, there is also a historical element to it
    (‘transmitted from generation to generation’). This resounds in the term’s common root
    with the ‘inheritance’ of universal cultural property.23 Therefore, not only the Byzantine
    church of San Vitale in Ravenna, which concomitantly is cultural property, is part of
    cultural heritage, but also the <em>A Tenore</em> song from Sardegna.24 This was recently included on the UNESCO Masterpieces list of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity25, which
    closely resembles the World Heritage list.
    In addition, there is an element of actual or perceived threat to cultural heritage inherent
    in the concept, hence requiring preservation. This is revealed in an exemplary manner by
    the explanation why the A Tenore song as a form of cultural expression needs protection
    in the UNESCO Masterpieces list:</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘Like many oral traditions, the A Tenore song is especially vulnerable to changes in the socioeconomic
structure, such as the decline of the pastoral culture and the increase of tourism in
Sardinia. The diversity of forms and repertoire is slowly decreasing. There is a tendency to
perform on stage in front of (tourist) audiences, which affects the originally very intimate way this
music was performed. Furthermore, many young people emigrate from the rural areas, making the
transmission of the A Tenore songs within the villages increasingly difficult.’26
    </blockquote>
    <p>A further dimension, which is not yet clearly reflected in the 2003 Intangible Cultural
Heritage Convention, was added by the 2005 Convention on the Protection and
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (CCDE): the protection of the
plurality of culture and cultural diversity per se. This opens up new scope for positive
legal obligations – obligations to protect and possibly to promote cultural heritages. It is
not only for the sake of protecting existing and specific cultural identities any more that
cultural heritage is protected, but – not unlike the protection of biodiversity – cultural
diversity is recognized as a common heritage of humanity. It may be debated whether the
protection of biodiversity and cultural diversity are sufficiently similar to share the same
rationale.27 This may at least be questioned with regard to the somewhat utilitarian
rationale of preserving genetic diversity in a biodiversity context. On a wider scale,
where diversity may be considered a value and aim in itself, there may be more in
common.
However, the recognition of the importance of cultural diversity per se is legally
significant because it broadens the scope of legal obligations that can be derived from the
concept of cultural heritage towards positive obligations: not only well established
cultural expressions may claim to be protected from state interference. A threatened
expression of cultural heritage may actively require states to safeguard it. If a threatened
heritage ceases to exist, it is not relevant for a cultural identity any more and would lose
its protection as cultural heritage. However, with an increasing recognition that not only
an individually identity-relevant cultural heritage deserves protection but also the very
plurality of such heritage, active steps might be required to maintain cultural diversity.
This would result in obligations even to maintain and develop new cultural heritage – a
new type of obligation that might be seen as counterbalancing the fact that some cultural
heritages also become unacceptable in view of the development of human rights.28
In this sense, the preamble of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of
the Diversity of Cultural Expressions stresses both the openness by form and substance of
cultural expressions and content and that cultural diversity per se is ‘a common heritage
of humanity’:
</p>
<blockquote>‘Affirming that cultural diversity is a defining characteristic of humanity,
  Conscious that cultural diversity forms a common heritage of humanity and should be cherished
  and preserved for the benefit of all,…’29</blockquote>
<p>There is not only a shift from highbrow tangible cultural property of universal value to a
  more pluralist conception of culture by content and form and geographic perception.
  There is a further shift in what amounts to higher ranking (universal) cultural heritage of
  mankind.30 Whereas traditionally one could make out absolute or universal cultural
  values, today it is at least also stressed in the 2005 Convention on the Protection and
  Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions that the very plurality of cultural
  ‘heritages’ amounts to a common heritage of mankind. This means a shift from a
  substantive identity-based to a formal diversity-based definition, and might be seen as a
  reaction and counterpoint to economic globalisation with its actual or perceived loss of
  diversity.31 This was, for example, also the conclusion of the UN Commission on Human
  Rights’ (Subcommission on Protection of Minorities) Special Rapporteur, who
  formulated Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of the Heritage of Indigenous
  People:</p>
  <blockquote>‘The effective protection of the heritage of the indigenous peoples of the world benefits all
    humanity. Cultural diversity is essential to the adaptability and creativity of the human species as a
    whole.’32</blockquote>
  <p>Calling the plurality of cultural heritage a common heritage of mankind places the
    concept at least from a terminological perspective into the context of the idea of a
    common heritage of mankind developed for physical spaces. It has so far been used for
    the deep seabed, the Antarctic and outer space, which are characterised by being free
    from individual states’ sovereign rights, not being subject to appropriation, being
    managed and their benefits exploited in a shared and equitable manner, and by being
    supposed to be used only for peaceful purposes. The already established concept of
    common heritage, therefore, does not fit cultural heritage very well in so far as the
    common heritage has a physical connotation of space. The recognition of a universal
    value of the plurality of cultural heritage that is inherent in calling it a ‘global commons’
    seems to be more akin to the value-oriented concepts of jus cogens or erga omnes
    obligations or the idea of ‘humanity’ protected by criminalising on the international level
    crimes against humanity.33
    In its other respects, the 2005 Convention confirms the definition of the 2003 Intangible
    Cultural Heritage Convention:34 Culture here is pluralistic, not confined to highbrow
    culture. The concept is broadened from cultural property as an absolute term to cultural
    heritage, which may be more local, more subjective, more relative and in whatever,
    tangible or intangible form, but there must be an artistic dimension and one of creativity.
    In its orientation towards identity and its historic dimension (‘passed on’), cultural
    heritage differs from another one to be found in the context of the protection of culture
    and cultural rights: that of cultural life. The concept of cultural expression can be seen as the mediator between cultural life and cultural heritage. On the one hand, it is oriented
    towards identity and by has a historic dimension, shared by cultural heritage; on the other
    hand, the Convention stresses the plurality of cultural expression which brings it close to
    the concept or cultural life.</p>

    <h4>Cultural Life</h4>
    <p>Looking at ‘culture’ in a legal framework, a further concept and meaning can be
      distinguished: cultural life (vita culturale) in an anthropological meaning35, describes a
      community’s way of life in a pluralist sense. It is even broader than the concept of
      cultural heritage and comprises wider forms of creative or expressive activity.</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘The totality of the knowledge and practices, both intellectual and material, of each of the
particular groups of a society, and – at a certain level – of a society itself as a whole. From food to
dress, from household techniques to industrial techniques, from forms of politeness to mass media,
from work rhythm to the learning of family rules, all human practices, all invented and
manufactured materials are concerned and constitute, in their relationships and their totality,
“culture”’.36
    </blockquote>
    <p>‘Cultural life’ is reflected in the human right to participate freely in cultural life in Art. 27
      of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Art. 15 of the 1966 International
      Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)37 and has been elaborated
      upon in the 1976 UNESCO Recommendation on Participation in Cultural Life. The
      Recommendation especially broadens the concept of culture</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‘to include all forms of creativity and expression of groups or individuals, both in their ways of
life and in their artistic activities’.38
    </blockquote>
    <p>The preamble states the reason for this:</p>
    <blockquote>‘culture is not merely an accumulation of works and knowledge which an elite produces, collects
      and conserves in order to place it within reach of all; or that a people rich in its past and its
      heritage offers to others as a model which their own history has failed to provide for them; that
      culture is not limited to access to works of art and the humanities, but is at one and the same time
      the acquisition of knowledge, the demand for a way of life and the need to communicate.’39</blockquote>
    
    <p>With a broad understanding of ‘cultural heritage’, there is a great deal of overlap between
      cultural life and cultural heritage. In contrast to the concept of cultural heritage, on the
      one hand, there appears to be no necessary (but a possible) link to expressions of human
      creativity with the idea of cultural life; other forms of expression, such as sports, games
      and hobbies, could be included.40 On the other hand even a certain sport, say cricket, may
      be said to express a creative idea of a group in the wider sense and thus participate in the
      cultural heritage of a group – or nation. Yet it should be possible to distinguish – at least
      in theory – between mere ‘cultural life’ or the human right to participate in cultural life
      and ‘cultural heritage’ along the lines of cultural identity, because there is at least not
      necessarily a dimension of cultural identity in all forms of cultural life.41 In practice, it
      will be very difficult to distinguish whether practices are relevant for cultural identity or
      not. Even where they are not, cultural heritage and cultural life and cultural rights on an
      individual level share one of their rationales – to allow for the free development of the
      individual in the context of his or her community.
      Wherever the distinction may be drawn, the right to participate in cultural life is
      important for the concept of cultural heritage as a right to develop a cultural identity and
      hence new forms of cultural heritage.42 While potentially all forms of expression can
      make this transition to become identity-relevant, many of them will not.</p>
      <h4>Cultural Rights</h4>
      <p>Cultural rights (diritti culturali) as laid down as a second generation of human rights,
        most prominently in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
        of 1966, are individual human rights in the sphere of culture to engage in, participate in
        and to oblige the state ‘to the maximum of its available resources’43 to maintain and
        promote an infrastructure of culture, such as education. They are likely to be more clearly
        defined rights that also incidentally protect cultural heritage. They are thus related to
        individual identity and the development of a personality, linking cultural rights and human dignity. Although they are conceptualised as individual rights, they may have a
        collective connotation where the exercise of a cultural right requires communication,
        similar to the right of assembly. In contrast to the concept of a cultural heritage, they do
        not make reference to cultural identity, especially not that of a group. They can, however,
        function as the precondition for identity-based rights and as a starting point for the
        evolution of new expressions of cultural heritage.</p>

      <h3>Holders of a Right to ‘Cultural Heritage’ – A Subjective Right?</h3>
      <p>Although the CICH 2003 and CCDE 2005 name as their objective the protection of
        intangible cultural heritage and the diversity of cultural expression, the obligations laid
        down are technically speaking obligations on states to do so via their national cultural
        policies, and to some extent through international cooperation. The instruments are
        therefore, on the face of it, mere interstate obligations and do not confer a right to cultural
        heritage on individuals or groups, although these are intended to be the beneficiaries. In
        this respect they are similar to the humanitarian law of armed conflict, as reflected, for
        example, in the 1954 Hague Convention and its protocols and the early minorities
        protection treaties which impose duties on states but do not confer individual rights. A
        further prominent example is the Genocide Convention of 1948 with its obligations on
        states to prevent and to punish acts of genocide.44</p>
        <p>However, the first step in the genesis of a subjective right is to remove subject matters,
          which regularly reflect international values that have become recognised, from the whim
          of state sovereignty.45 The additional qualitative development of a subjective right may
          or may not follow subsequently. This analysis is based on the positivist premise that an
          individual is subject (rather than an object or mere beneficiary) of international law
          where he or she is vested with legal rights (rather than ‘natural rights’) that can be
          enforced somehow. The evolution towards a more relative and subjective value of
          cultural heritage goes hand in hand with the emergence of individuals or groups
          (minorities, peoples) acquiring subjective rights generally and possible rights to cultural
          heritage in particular because of the following factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is an existing body of established human rights per se, and there is a close
              relationship between ‘cultural heritage’ and existing subjective cultural rights.</li>
            <li>Cultural heritage and cultural rights are linked by their reference to ‘cultural
              identity’. This underlying rationale may serve as communicating tubes mutually
              cross-fertilising cultural rights and cultural heritage norms.</li>
            <li>Cultural identity is part of an individual’s personality and therefore, has a close
              relationship with, and is an element of an emerging right to human dignity;46 the
              latter becomes more and more a separate human right also under international
              law, for example via Art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.47 The
              partly shared rationale of cultural heritage protection and human rights might lead
              to an alignment of cultural heritage with human rights, which might help raising
              cultural heritage to the level of subjective rights to cultural heritage.</li>
            <li>Last but not least: cultural heritage, through its constituting factor of being
              relevant to cultural identity, is closely linked to the right of peoples to selfdetermination.
              Even if the principle of self-determination itself is loaded with
              uncertainties about the holder and the scope of the right, cultural identity can be
              described as one out of several factors that might define a group that may be
              entitled to the right to self-determination.</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>The Added Value of a Separate Individual or Group Right to Cultural Heritage</h4>
          <p>A number of specialised <em>individual rights</em>, such as the freedom to have and to exercise
            one’s religion, freedom of expression, privacy as the right freely to develop one’s
            personality, freedom of assembly and association, protect aspects of what is comprised by
            cultural heritage. Cultural heritage will have an independent meaning in law only if it
            denotes a content beyond being a mere umbrella term for individual rights.48 Again one
            can point to the element of cultural identity that adds to most of the rights mentioned a
            more subjective, intangible element linking the individual’s identity with that of other
            individuals or that of a community. The protection of cultural identity as a more specific
            aspect or the right to self-determination could promote this collective right, giving it more
            specific content and hence possibly increase its degree of adherence and enforcement.
            Consequently, duties incumbent on states to promote cultural heritage would be more
            ‘holistic’ than duties to promote narrower, specific human rights.</p>
            <p>A further advantage of a separate individual or collective right may be that the individual
              or non-state actor gains significance in enforcing international law, either on the
              international plane or via available national mechanisms. Even though weak, an enforcement interest may add to the enforcement of norms which otherwise remain all
              too abstract public interests.</p>
            <h4>An Individual Right to Cultural Heritage?</h4>
            <p>One could try to compile a list of rights drawn from international human rights law that
              incidentally or directly protects cultural heritage. These individual human rights, which
              also protect aspects of cultural heritage and are specific expressions of human dignity,
              might provide an argument for an emerging individual right to cultural heritage. Among
              the more obvious rights that have a more direct impact on culture would be the protection
              of privacy49 (private life), family, home, correspondence (Art. 17 of the International
              Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, ICCPR), freedom of thought, conscience
              and religion (‘to have or to adopt’, Art. 18 ICCPR), freedom of opinion and expression
              (Art. 19 ICCPR), the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association (Art 21, 22
              ICCPR) and the protection of the family, freedom to marry (and not to marry – ‘free and
              full consent’, Art. 23 ICCPR). The right to education (Art. 13 ICESCR) and the ‘right of
              everyone to take part in cultural life’ (Art. 15 ICESCR and Art. XIII of the American
              Declaration or the Rights and Duties of Man, Art. 17(2) of the African Charter on Human
              and Peoples’ Rights (1981), Art. 27(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
              <p>This is not the place to enter into a debate about whether a right to cultural heritage may
                be an individual human right or a right of groups or peoples. It is tempting to leave the
                question open with O’Keefe, as it could be either, according to context.50 The case for an
                individual right, separate and independent from codified specific cultural rights, seems to
                be weaker than for a collective right (leaving aside for the moment questions relating to
                collective rights as a matter of principle). Although cultural rights are individual rights
                and share the underlying link to human dignity and might share at least some of the
                rationales of the protection of cultural heritage, it seems hardly possible to derive from
                this proximity a subjective individual right to cultural heritage. The links seem too vague
                and tenuous to draw such a far-reaching conclusion of a subjective right. Also, the precise
                content of cultural rights and matching obligations on states are not easily established.51
                One does not have to subscribe to the restrictive view that social (and cultural) rights are
                not fully contingent on economic resources. Even if one assumes instead that states are
                under an obligation to ‘ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights’ contained in the ICESCR 1966,52 there is still a lot – too
                much – uncertainty. Deriving a subjective right to a cultural heritage from the concept of
                a ‘minimum core obligation’53 seems to go one step too far.</p>
                <p>Further, raising cultural heritage to such an elevated position of a subjective individual
                  right would not be without problems for the protection of human rights generally.54
                  Indeed the broader the protection of culture is drawn, as reflected in a widening of the
                  definition of culture from absolute universal cultural property to subjective and more
                  relative or pluralist forms of intangible expressions and diversity itself, the more difficult
                  it becomes to establish the content of such a right. This is even more so where the
                  dimension of protection would be not just in the negative duty not to destroy or to prevent
                  destruction but in the positive dimension of human rights, requiring positive state action
                  to promote cultural expressions. This is reflected in Art. 17(3) of the African Charter on
                  Human and Peoples’ Rights which refers – in the context of positive obligations – to a
                  duty of the state, not an individual right:</p>
                <blockquote>‘The promotion and protection of morals and traditional values recognized by the community shall
                  be the duty of the state’.</blockquote>
          <h4>A Collective Right to Cultural Heritage</h4>
          <p>The case for a collective right to cultural heritage seems to be more promising and more
            fitting, although its ally, the right to self-determination, is itself lacking clarity and shape.
            A right to cultural heritage can be partly seen as a special right derived from the right to
            self-determination of peoples to ‘freely pursue their economic, social and cultural
            development’ (common Art. 1 of the ICCPR and ICESCR; Art. 22 of the African
            Charter) as a third generation of human rights, alongside the other derived rights to
            permanent sovereignty over natural resources and the right to development. Rhetoric
            resembles that used in the context of self-determination with regard to colonial peoples
            and with regard to international development. In the same vein, the fact that the right of
            ethnic or linguistic minorities ‘to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their
            own religion, or to use their own language’ is mentioned and protected in Art. 27 ICCPR,
            may be used in support of a group right. Further, the right to develop a cultural identity,laid down in Art. 1(2) of the UNESCO Declaration of the Principles of International
            Cultural Co-operation 1966, could be mentioned as necessarily being a collective right.
            Making ‘cultural identity’ part of the definition of cultural heritage seems to reflect a
            trend for cultural heritage protection to move towards collective and group rights.55 The
            hard legal provisions are those of the general provisions on self-determination of the
            1966 Covenants and the African Charter. Art. 27 ICCPR is more ambiguous, and it is
            debated whether it is an individual or collective right, but it could arguably support the
            trend. But there is plenty of ‘soft law’ reflecting the tendency of cultural heritage
            protection to move towards a right of people as a new generation of cultural rights. The
            Principles of UN Special Rapporteur Daes on the Protection of the Heritage of
            Indigenous Peoples of 1995 explicitly state that the protection of indigenous peoples’
            heritage should be based on the right to self-determination.56 Art. 1 (2) UNESCO
            Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Co-operation 1966 states:</p>
          <blockquote>‘Each people has the right and duty to develop its culture.’</blockquote>
          <p>Similarly, Art. 2 of the 1976 Algiers Universal Declaration of the Rights of Peoples
            reads:</p>
          <blockquote>‘Every people has the right to the respect of its national and cultural identity.’</blockquote>
          <p>It thus recognises the subjective, group-identity-related core of the definition of cultural
            heritage. The right is formulated in the context of the right of a people to existence, which
            is the most basic right derived from the principle of self-determination. As a result of
            legal rules centred around the individual or groups and peoples, the development of
            ‘culture’ in international law follows the general trend towards a less state-centred
            international order, more similar to that of Gentili, who was criticised as not having been
            at the height of his time because he did not have a state-centred image of the world
            according to the then emerging Westphalian model.57 At least from today’s perspective
            he can be said to have been ahead of his time.</p>
        <h3>Problems relating to a Right to Cultural Heritage</h3>
        <p>In spite of some potential benefits of a subjective right to cultural heritage, there are
          distinct problems and dangers:</p>
        <h4>Legal Guarantees of Factual Circumstances?</h4>
        <p>One could question whether cultural heritage is a concept that can be regulated by law at
          all because it is the result of sociological, anthropological and cultural processes which
          cannot be guaranteed by law. A related concern might be that some of these rights, like
          that of cultural identity, rely on joint exercise with others. They share the fact that they
          become meaningless when the factual circumstances are not such as to provide a basis for
          the exercise of cultural rights.
          First, this is not a specific concern with regard to cultural heritage but affects all rights
          that are exercised jointly with other, be they individual or collective. While it is conceded
          that the emergence or even continued existence of cultural heritage cannot be ensured
          ultimately by law, it can be protected when having come into existence; or – as might be
          derived from the CCDE – diversity may be encouraged and lead to the development of
          new cultural heritage. In the dimension of a positive obligation, therefore, the criticism is
          not all-defeating. Further, it is not uncommon for human rights to protect subjective
          concepts: the freedom of religion would be another example.</p>
        <h4>Problems of Definitions and Conceptualisation</h4>
        <p>A different concern arises from the lack of precise legal definitions. It has to be said
          immediately that these cannot be resolved in this paper; they are problems of third
          generation rights generally.58 These problems may affect the status of the protection – as
          an obligation on states or a subjective right.59 The term ‘peoples’ is subject to a perennial
          debate around the holder of the right to self-determination. The concept of cultural
          identity is difficult to define as it is a strongly subjective notion. Defining ‘peoples’ in
          terms of cultural identities could be a theoretical solution, but it would be subject to
          similar concerns that are generally voiced in reaction to attempts to define peoples at a
          unit below the level of a population of a nation state.60 Hence attempts might give rise to
          circular definitions in relation to culture61
          Further, the attempt to distinguish cultural heritage from cultural life reveals that
          broadening the notion of culture is a two-edged sword: it gives rise to the danger that the
          concept becomes meaningless if cultural life is equated with leisure activities and where it is unclear how far a practice shapes the identity of a community. Is Big Brother shaping
          the identity of modern British (or Italian) culture? Is football, cricket etc.? While it may
          be difficult, it may still be possible to make a distinction between the freedom to act and
          identity-relevant cultural activities in principle.</p>

        <h4>Conflicts of Rights</h4>
        <p>More problematic are some of the consequences of expanding the protection of culture to
          the protection of cultural heritage through individual or collective subjective rights.
          Where there are rights, there are conflicting rights of others. What if human rights clash
          with actual or perceived cultural heritage? Who is in a capacity to define whether cultural
          phenomena qualify as cultural heritage or how strongly they may be weighed against
          other interests and, most notably, human rights?
          One reply could be that there is nothing special about the fact that recognising a right to a
          cultural heritage increases the potential for clash. This happens all the time where human
          rights are at issue and usually leads to balancing processes, which may be criticised in
          individual instances but do not seem to be a fundamentally unsuitable tool. Further, a
          right to cultural heritage of individuals or groups may strengthen their position against
          their own state which may, for example, be trying to exploit the natural resources in an
          area that is vital for the culture of a people. It may even be directed against a foreign
          state, as in the Case of the Temple of Preah Vihear62 shows which is still entangled in the
          ongoing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia. The case concerned the right of
          access to a Khmer religious site which was under Thai control but which the International
          Court of Justice held to be Cambodian. However, raising cultural heritage to the level of
          individual rights would at the same time also reduce the influence of the state to ensure
          and safeguard conflicting human rights.</p>
        <h5>Two Conflicting Rights Based on Cultural Heritage?</h5>
        <p>Cultural heritage may be attributed to several peoples. Where world cultural heritage is at
          issue, this will be quite common. The often quoted example is that of the Parthenon
          frieze, renamed Elgin marbles, where British and Greek claims clash that could possibly
          even be construed as claims on the level of cultural heritage on both sides. Leaving aside
          the problems raised by colonialism and unlawful acquisition of objects, a history as a
          collecting (and preserving) nation could become part of the cultural heritage of a nation,
          so that indeed two claims on the level of cultural heritage could clash. Again, this is an issue of balancing – at the same level, possibly even that of cultural heritage on both
          sides – which cannot be dealt with in detail here.63 One option applied in the context of
          ownership is the Canadian rule of 35 years of possession;64 another one could allocate
          decisive weight to the legitimacy of the sale and purchase, issues that were recently also
          illustrated by the Gustav Klimt paintings in Austria and the prototypical expressionist
          painting by Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner street scene in a Berlin collection.65 But this takes us
          into the private law side of the restitution of art that cannot be pursued in greater detail
          here.
          There may even be conflicting and mutually exclusive ways of protecting cultural
          heritage, as shown by the example of excavations to preserve cultural heritage which
          would have to happen in places of worship of indigenous population.66</p>
        <h5>Conflicts between Cultural Heritage and Human Rights</h5>
        <p>The potential clash between human rights and cultural heritage becomes very obvious
          where there are deeply ingrained practices that fulfil the definition of cultural heritage but
          at the same time violate human rights. Examples are female genital mutilation, severe
          dress codes, forced prostitution, ‘witch’ hunting, honour killings, forced marriages or
          other forms of severe discrimination against women in society. Cultural heritage
          protection (re)inserts cultural relativism into human rights law where a fragile consensus
          over the universality of most basic human rights seems to have become accepted. In the
          extreme this might erode the very concept of universal human rights being outside the
          domaine resérvé of states. The dilemma is well summarised by the report of the UN
          Human Rights Commission’s Special Rapporteur on violence against women on Cultural
          Practices in the Family that are Violent towards Women, Radhika Coomaraswamy:</p>
          <blockquote>‘By arguing that custom, tradition and religion cannot be invoked by State parties to defend
            violence against women in the family, international standards reject the cultural relativist argument that cultural practices that are violent towards women in the family should be shielded
            from international scrutiny.’67</blockquote>
          <blockquote>‘The universal standards of human rights are often denied full operation when it comes to the
            rights of women. Throughout the world, there are practices in the family that are violent towards
            women and harmful to their health. Young girls are circumcised, live under severe dress codes, are
            given in prostitution, denied property rights and killed for the sake of honour in the family. This
            report documents a number of cultural practices which violate women’s human rights to bodily
            integrity and to expression, as well as undermining essential values of equality and dignity. These
            practices and many others constitute a form of domestic violence but have avoided national and
            international scrutiny because they are seen as cultural practices that deserve tolerance and
            respect.’</blockquote>
          <blockquote>‘Cultural relativism is often used as an excuse to permit inhumane and discriminatory practices
            against women in the community, despite clear provisions in many human rights instruments,
            including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, in
            accordance with which States parties shall take all appropriate measures to modify the social and
            cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of
            prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or
            the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women (art.5).’68</blockquote>
          <blockquote>‘Nevertheless, many of the practices enumerated in the next section are unconscionable and
            challenge the very concept of universal human rights. Many of them involve “severe pain and
            suffering” and may be considered “torture like” in their manifestation. Others such as property and
            marital rights are inherently unequal and blatantly challenge the international imperatives towards
            equality. The right to be free from torture is considered by many scholars to be jus cogens, a norm
            of international law that cannot be derogated from by nation States. So fundamental is the right to
            be free from torture that, along with the right to be free from genocide, it is seen as a norm that
            binds all nation States, whether or not they have signed any international convention or document.
            Therefore those cultural practices that involve “severe pain and suffering” for the woman or the
            girl child, those that do not respect the physical integrity of the female body, must receive
            maximum international scrutiny and agitation. It is imperative that practices such as female
            genital mutilation, honour killings, Sati or any other form of cultural practice that brutalizes the
            female body receive international attention, and international leverage should be used to ensure
            that these practices are curtailed and eliminated as quickly as possible.’69</blockquote>
          <p>The 2005 Cultural Diversity of Expression Convention recognizes the danger of
            relativism and strikes an a priori balance in favour of (other) human rights by stating
            clearly that no derogation from human rights can be justified by recourse to cultural
            heritage.</p>
          <blockquote>‘Article 2 – Guiding principles</br>
            1. Principle of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
            Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms,
            such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of
            individuals to choose cultural expressions, are guaranteed. No one may invoke the provisions of
            this Convention in order to infringe human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the
            Universal Declaration of Human Rights or guaranteed by international law, or to limit the scope
            thereof.’70</blockquote>
          <p>The CCDE refers to all and any human right under international law. The theme and
            sometimes uneasy fit of human rights and ‘culture’ is also taken up by human rights
            treaties, such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against
            Women (CEDAW) of 1979 whose Art. 2 lit. f) and Art. 5 lit. a) impose a clear obligation
            on states</p>
          <blockquote>‘to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws,
            regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women;’71</blockquote>
          <p>and</p>
          <blockquote>‘to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving
            the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of
            the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.’</blockquote>
          <p>Also, human rights modify the protection of cultural heritage to the extent that members
            of a community who would like to opt out of being part of the preservation and
            continuation of the cultural heritage, must be allowed to do so. Some sort of balancing
            might be permissible here. In contrast, affirmative action to compensate for past
            collective injustices is limited by the human rights violations created by new individual
            injustices. However, how legal systems strike this balance, varies. This also raises the
            related question how far states have a discretion (or margin of appreciation) in the
            interpretation of international human rights which concerns not only the overcoming of
            human rights violations but the very definition of the content of human rights. The
            practice of arranged and forced marriages, both of which might be seen as reflecting 
            cultural heritage, exemplifies how thin the line is between accepted cultural practices and
            those considered to violate human rights. In the case of forced marriages, the UN Special
            Rapporteur considers cultural heritage aspects as secondary, differentiating from
            ‘arranged marriages, which operate successfully within many communities.’72
            The quoted Article 2 CCDE suggests that it is not merely a result of normative hierarchy
            that other human rights (expression, communication) deserve priority. The priority seems
            to apply beyond ius cogens norms, such as the prohibition of torture and inhuman and
            degrading treatment and the like. While the result is welcome, it does not seem to be
            immediately obvious how this a priori balance can be construed in law if subjective
            rights conflict which are presumably of equal strength. If neither of them is a ius cogens
            norm, the decision can be reached only by a balancing process in each individual case. If
            the protection of cultural heritage is only a duty on the state (as opposed to an individual
            right), such a priori balancing is more easily reconcilable with general principles of
            human rights law.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
          <p>It has been shown that, with the creation and evolution of the concept of cultural heritage,
            a trend can be sketched out. This trend is characterised by a move away from a universal,
            absolute and objective conception of culture to a more subjective, pluralist and to a
            certain extent more relative concept. This leads on the one hand to a wider protection of
            ‘culture’. On the other hand it also opens up new terrain for clashes with human rights.
            As long as this trend to increase the protection of cultural heritage and to promote
            plurality and diversity, and possibly new cultural heritage, occurs within a framework of
            human rights, it cannot be subject to infinite relativism. International law here itself
            becomes an input factor into the development of cultural heritage. It provides the impetus
            for change of a dynamic concept of cultural heritage where cultural heritage is found to
            be violating fundamental human rights.73 This also becomes obvious in the
            recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur Radhika Coomaraswamy:</p>
          <blockquote>‘These ideologies and structures emerged in a different era but continue to be harmful to women
            and to dominate public opinion and individual lifestyles, thus preventing the eradication of
            practices that are harmful to women. The report emphasizes State responsibility to eradicate
            violence in the family and documents the positive developments strategies to deal with harmful
            cultural practices developed by States in cooperation with women’s organizations.’74</blockquote>
          <p>The report then concludes with a number of recommendations aimed at obligations and
            efforts to eliminate cultural practices (that may be part of a cultural heritage) that violate
            human rights:</p>
          <blockquote>
            123.‘States should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their
obligation to eradicate violence against women and the girl child in the family.
124.(…)
125.States should develop penal, civil and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to
punish violence in the family and to provide redress to women victims, even if the violence is
associated with a cultural practice. The penal sanction should be strong and effective and not
merely on paper.
126.States should develop national plans of action to eradicate violence in the family, particularly
violence related to cultural practices through health and education programmes at the
grass-roots level.
127.(…)
128.(…)
129.States should adopt all appropriate measures in the field of education to modify the social and
cultural patterns of conduct that foster cultural practices in the family that are violent towards
women.
130.States should collect data and statistics on the pervasiveness of cultural practices that are
violent towards women, so as to ensure the development of appropriate strategies for their
eradication.
131.States should include the measures they have taken to combat cultural practices that are
violent towards women in their reports under relevant human rights instruments.
132.States should recognize the important role that women’s groups and women’s organizations
play in the eradication of cultural practices that are violent towards women and give them all
necessary support and encouragement.’
          </blockquote>
      <p>From a perspective de lege ferenda the positive effects of a stronger protection of cultural
        heritage (through, for example, an individual human right) and the negative effects of less
        flexibility in reconciling conflicting human rights claims with cultural heritage (because
        they must be balanced at the same level, unless ius cogens human rights are in play) must
        be taken into account. While the subjective notion inherent in cultural heritage may
        generally be welcomed as broadening obligations on states protecting individuals or
        groups and in increasing the protection of cultural identities, it may be questioned
        whether the small added benefit of doing so by means of creating an individual right is
        worth the significant challenge to established human rights from a relativist perspective.
        An objective obligation on states to protect, safeguard and to allow cultural heritage to develop, embedded in existing human rights, seems to be the more appropriate way to
        reconcile the conflicting principles of cultural heritage and human rights protection.</p>
